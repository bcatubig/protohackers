## Notes

### 0

-   Took me a hot minute to figure out how to do this

### 1

-   JSON JSON JSON
-   Learned about prime numbers

### 2

-   Learned about Big Endian and sending numbers over the network
-   Spent forever figuring out why 200k test case was constantly failing. Turns out the way I calculated the mean was causing an int32 overflow.
-   Experimented with [B-Tree](https://github.com/tidwall/btree) library which was a lot of fun.
